## Audio Effects

1. Display the song's MetaInfo

2. Implement (using what you learned in theoretical classes) functions that:
    - Reverse the music
    - Apply fade-in and fade-out effects
    - Apply a low-pass filter

 (Hint: to make it noticeable you probably will need to take into account
 considerably more than just two or three adjacent samples)

3. Implement other sound effects. Be creative and show us what you can do!
